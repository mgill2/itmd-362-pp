## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=53L150kitnVqPiBlLgCf+uMaFsS
Your Rationale: I choose these colors because I wanted a darker blue to be the primary color and then have the green and purple as accents. This would help with staring at screens for a long period of time instead of bright colors. 

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=31E1g0knhPNWZtauElM5e+r07YA
Your Rationale: I choose really bright colors so that it blends in with all the bright colors of garden as well as show the "spring time" feel. 

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=33n0B0kKmllyIvOE5pJQ9g-VDaF
Your Rationale: I went with a darker color so it does not blind the user and strain the users eyes. It also gives the company good base colors to work off of. 

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000B0kvcdplnmLqeikFM8IQV4s
Your Rationale: I choose red becuase rubys are red, and it would fit the build of ruby.
