# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I used the clarity point on Apple's site because this helps the user understand what you are trying to convey. It produces the right size and shapes for the user. The spacing shows that there is no inactvity. 

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I used the user control portion of Apple's HCI by implimenting boxes, this helpes the user with the choices and says "choose one". 

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I added the Enabling portion of the Windows guidlines to help the user be able to get to where they want to go, not give a bunch of features that are not used or wanted.
