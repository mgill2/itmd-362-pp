# Production Problem 09: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

1.Does the structure fit the purpose
2.What do you want to find
3.Is excessive scrolling required
4.Is it cluttered
5.Is download time fast enough
6.Does the site work on all platforms
7.Do pages load in 3-10 seconds
8.If the submit button is used as an image map, identify headers for the table rows and colums. 
9.Does the user have control over navigation
10. Are links clearly marked
